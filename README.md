## Introduction
This is a code repository for the corresponding Project.

In this project, I build a Complex Expense Budget Tracker. While building it, I learn many advanced React & JavaScript topics. Some of them are State Management in React, Context API, Local Storage, Material UI, and how to create a scalable React folder structure. But most importantly, I learn how to add voice capabilities to your applications using Speechly. 

Setup:
- run ```npm i && npm start```
- If above command gives you an error then try this command: ```npm i --legacy-peer-deps``` and to start the server try: ```npm start or npm run start```
